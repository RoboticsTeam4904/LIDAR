To build this test code, first you need to install some libraries.

If you don't have brew installed, follow the directions at http://brew.sh/ to install it.

In Terminal, run

```
brew tap homebrew/versions
brew install glfw3
brew install glew
```

You can then compile this code using the Makefile, by running
```
make
```
when in this folder.
